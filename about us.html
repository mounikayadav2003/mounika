    <p><b>Zomato initially launched as an online restaurant directory called Foodiebay. Zomato 
        CEO thought that the name was too similar to eBay. 
        So a few naming iterations later, they came up with Zomato. 
        Zomato used innovative marketing techniques and deals with restaurant 
        owners to offer restaurant-goers discounts and deals, making it rapidly 
        gain popularity.
        Zomato initially focused on growth through word-of-mouth and added 
         over 1400 restaurants around New Delhi to its list. Zomato had over 
        2M customers, 8000 restaurants and expanded its operations to 5 cities 
        in less than two years. Backed by its investors, Zomato grew through 
        expansions and acquisitions, making it one of the most valuable food 
        delivery aggregators globally.</p>
